Welcome to the ClimaCell API community. Here you can find information on how to join the community, get involved, and help us improve the product and documentation.

## About

ClimaCell uses data from weather databases, wireless networks, internet-of-things (IoT) devices, and cellular networks and analyzes it in order for you to predict, automate, and solve your biggest weather challenges with ClimaCell. To get a better idea of what ClimaCell is and what we do, visit our [website](https://climacell.co).
