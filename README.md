Welcome to the Tomorrow.io API community. Here you can find information on how to join the community, get involved, and help us improve the product and documentation.

## About

Tomorrow.io uses data from weather databases, wireless networks, internet-of-things (IoT) devices, and cellular networks and analyzes it in order for you to predict, automate, and solve your biggest weather challenges with Tomorrow.io. To get a better idea of what Tomorrow.io is and what we do, visit our [website](https://tomorrow.io).
